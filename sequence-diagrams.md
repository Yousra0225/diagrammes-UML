# Sequence Diagrams
*The sequence diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows the order of interactions between objects/actors, over time to execute a specific scenario*.  
The main concepts found in a UML sequence diagram are: 
* **The participants** : the actors or objects that are involved in the scenario.
* **The time line** : the order of the interactions between the participants.
* **The messages** : the interactions between the participants.
* **Creation and destruction** : the creation and destruction of the participants.
